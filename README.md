This package contains a release of training and test data to aid in modeling affect and emotion from conversations, focusing on the problem of how speakers use emotions to react to a situation and to each other. We introduce the OffMyChest conversation dataset, and invite submissions for the Computational Linguistics Affect Understanding (CL-Aff) Shared Task on Affect in Conversations. 

Please "WATCH" this repository! We may be pushing more updates in the following weeks.
After the Shared Task, we also plan to further enrich this data, with more annotations, meta-features and trained classifiers to aid with downstream applications.

If you use the data and publish, please let us know and cite our CL-Aff overview paper:
