# CL-Aff Shared Task: Get it #OffMyChest
Corpus and annotations for the CL-Aff Shared Task - Get it #OffMyChest - from Nanyang Technological University Singapore

A part of the AffCon Workshop @ AAAI 2019 for Modeling Affect-in-Response

There is a growing interest in understanding how humans initiate and hold conversations. The affective understanding of conversations focuses on the problem of how speakers use emotions to react to a situation and to each other. We introduce the OffMyChest conversation dataset, and invite submissions for the Computational Linguistics Affect Understanding (CL-Aff) Shared Task on modeling interactive affective responses. 

**UPDATED SYSTEM RUNS SUBMISSION DEADLINE: December 13, 2019** 



## The Tasks

**GIVEN**: Sentences sampled out of the casual and confessional conversations among Redittors on the /r/CasualConversations and the /r/OffMyChest community, labeled for their disclosure and supportive characteristics.

**TASK 1** : Semi-supervised learning task: Predict labels for Disclosure and Supportiveness for sentences based on a small labeled and large unlabeled training data.    

**TASK 2**: Unsupervised task: Propose new characterizations and insights to model conversation dynamics.

## Corpus details (All released!)

**Unlabeled training set** :

**UNLABELED POSTS:** The top posts in 2018 in /r/CasualConversations and /r/OffMyChest mentionining any of the keyword terms. Posts that are parents of comments in the training and test sets are separately identified.

**UNLABELED COMMENTS:** Over 420k sentences extracted from 130k comments posted to "POSTS"


**Labeled training set** : 12,860 labeled sentences, extracted from the top comments posted to "POSTS".

**Test set:** 5,000 unlabeled sentences, extracted from the top comments posted to "POSTS".


## Label descriptions

Check out the annotation instructions under /docs/.

1. *Disclosure* is further categorized into informational and emotional disclosure.

2. *Supportiveness* is further categorized into general, informational, and emotional supportiveness.



## Git Contents

This is the open repository for Affect Understanding in Text and Annotations contributed to the public through the collaboration between Nanyang Technological University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Adobe Research India. It comprises comments (some labeled) and the parent posts (all unlabeled) from the /r/CasualConversations and the /r/OffMyChest communities
